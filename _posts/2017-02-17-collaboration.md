# Collaboration

Collaboration should be easy and straight forward. Why is this so hard to achieve?

Usually there are several issues to make this dream come true. For some reason when we create an intranet or any system for collaboration the no 1 concern is the look & feel of the system. Functionality and usability almost always come second. However, if you wan't to create something that is truly valued and used for years to come you need to start at the other end.

## SharePoint

We can help you create your collaboration system in SharePoint or SharePoint Online with Office365\.

Regardless of your current intranet system or previous projects we will make the best of your situation by thorough planning prior to implementation.
