            <description><![CDATA[<p>Our Services</p>,<h1>Collaboration</h1>,<p>Collaboration should be easy and straight forward. Why is this so hard to achieve?</p>,<p>Usually there are several issues to make this dream come true. For some reason when we create an intranet or any system for collaboration the no 1 concern is the look &amp; feel of the system. Functionality and usability almost always come second. However, if you wanâ€™t to create something that is truly valued and used for years to come you need to start at the other end.</p>,<h2>SharePoint</h2>,<p>We can help you create your collaboration system in SharePoint or SharePoint Online with Office365.</p>,<p>Regardless of your current intranet system or previous projects we will make the best of your situation by thorough planning prior to implementation.</p>]]></description>
